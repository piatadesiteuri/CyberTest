The primary compromise was **Confidentiality** because sensitive customer data (names, emails, credit cards) was exposed to unauthorized parties. The most critical immediate response is to:

1. **Immediate containment**: Patch the SQL injection vulnerability
2. **Access control**: Revoke compromised credentials and implement stronger authentication
3. **Data protection**: Encrypt remaining sensitive data

2. **Preserve evidence** - Memory dumps contain volatile data that disappears on reboot

4. **Contain the threat** - Stop the attack without destroying evidence

**Critical Evidence to Preserve:**
- **Memory dump** - Running processes, network connections, encryption keys
- **Network logs** - Traffic patterns, external IPs, data volumes
- **System logs** - Failed logins, privilege escalations, process executions
- **Timeline** - Exact sequence of events for reconstruction

- **A**: Powering down destroys volatile memory evidence
- **C**: Delays containment, allows more damage

**ROI Calculation:**

**Project A (EDR):**
- Annual savings: 80% √ó $100K = $80K
- ROI: ($80K - $50K) / $50K = 60%

**Project B (Zero Trust):**
- Annual savings: 95% √ó $500K = $475K  
- ROI: ($475K - $200K) / $200K = 137.5%

**Project C (DLP):**
- Annual savings: 90% √ó $1M = $900K
- ROI: ($900K - $75K) / $75K = 1100%

**However, Project B is best because:**
- **Highest absolute savings**: $475K vs $80K vs $900K
- **Balanced ROI**: 137.5% is excellent while being achievable
- **Strategic value**: Zero trust enables other security improvements
- **Risk mitigation**: Prevents the most common attack vector (lateral movement)

**Note**: While Project C has highest ROI, it's unrealistic to prevent 90% of all data exfiltration. Project B provides more realistic and sustainable risk reduction.`,

**Technical Controls:**
1. **Email Authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)**:

3. **Security Awareness Training**:
   - Teaches users to verify sender authenticity
   - Encourages reporting of suspicious emails
   - Creates security-conscious culture

- **B**: Password/MFA don't prevent phishing, audits are reactive
- **C**: Network controls don't stop email-based attacks
- **D**: Encryption/access controls don't prevent initial compromise

- Different consent mechanisms
- Varying data retention periods
- Conflicting requirements
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
- Different enforcement mechanisms and penalties
