FORCE RAILWAY EDGE CACHE CLEAR: Backend healthcheck succeeds but Edge returns 502

This suggests Railway Edge is caching the 502 response
or there's a routing issue between Edge and backend container

Need to:
1. Force complete redeploy of backend
2. Wait for Railway Edge cache to clear
3. Verify external routing works

Backend logs show all green:
✅ Healthcheck succeeded
✅ Server on port 8080 
✅ Database connected
